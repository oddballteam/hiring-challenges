# Next Steps

## Real-Time Code Pairing

We will be screen sharing during the interview, so that we can work together to create the solution during our session.

- Look over the assessment ahead of time to get your initial thoughts together, but do not being any actual solutioning or writing code.
- Set up your environment before the meeting with all of the boilerplate code in place, so that we can hit the ground running during the interview. Make sure it does run a basic "hello world" or equivalent, so that we maximize our time together.

We may not have time to finish the entire challenge during our limited time together. That's okay! Our goal is to get an idea of your skill level, see how you solve problems, and collaborate with you.
