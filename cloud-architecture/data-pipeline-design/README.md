# Data Pipeline Design

In this hypothetical challenge, we need to ingest data from a number of sources. Some of those sources will be ingested on a schedule, while others need to be processed in real time when data comes to us. The data is used by both analysts and to API clients.

You will design a system that accomplishes these needs and walk us through your design and tooling decisions.
