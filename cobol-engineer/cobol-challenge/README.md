# COBOL Code Review Exercise

## Background
The COBOL program for this coding challenge ([COBOL-Code-Challenge.cbl](COBOL-Code-Challenge.cbl)) reads an input file containing a series of record keys. The keys are cross-referenced against an internal (working storage) table, the contents of which are used to assign a category code based on the corresponding table entry's date and amount values. Once a category code has been determined, an output record is written to a separate file containing the key value, date, amount, and category code.

## Task
Review COBOL program [COBOL-Code-Challenge.cbl](COBOL-Code-Challenge.cbl) and do the following:

1. **Analyze** the program to gain a better understanding of the program's core functions.
2. **Resolve** the coding mistakes found in the program.
3. **Identify** opportunities for improving the program's processing performance, maintainability, scalability, and readability while preserving the program's core functions.

## Note
The interview team at Oddball recognizes that the time allowed to complete this exercise is limited. The team also does not anticipate the interviewee having the ability to compile or debug (using debug software) the COBOL program. The expectation is that not every mistake will be caught or opportunity for code improvement explored. However, task prioritization is a major component of this exercise and is something to be mindful of as you work through this challenge. Likewise, manual code tracing and problem solving skills, without overreliance on compile listings or debugging software, will also be gauged via this exercise.
