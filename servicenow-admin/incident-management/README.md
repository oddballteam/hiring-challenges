# ServiceNow Automated Incident Management

## Description

A software development company uses ServiceNow to manage IT operations, including incident management. They want to automate and streamline the process of handling bug reports and security incidents, which originate from various sources. The following outlines the current incident management process and the desired improvements:

- **Current Process:**

  - Incidents related to bugs and security vulnerabilities are reported through various channels:
    - Internal employees via ServiceNow service portal.
    - External customers via a public-facing web form.
    - Automated monitoring systems (e.g., system logs, security scans).
    - Manual entry by service desk agents.
  - Service desk agents manually create incident records in ServiceNow, leading to potential delays, data entry errors, and inconsistencies.
  - Incidents are triaged and assigned to development or security teams, often with manual routing and notification processes.
  - Updates and communication between development/security teams and the service desk are primarily manual, leading to potential communication gaps and delays in resolution.
    - The company uses JIRA for tracking software development tasks. There is a need for better integration between ServiceNow incident management and JIRA project management.
  - Managers need reports on incident trends, resolution times, and team performance, but current reporting is time-consuming and lacks the necessary detail.

- **Desired Improvements:**

  - Automate incident creation from all sources, including the service portal, web form, monitoring systems, and email, to ensure data consistency and improve agent efficiency.

  - Ensure accurate capture of incident details, such as affected system, error messages, and steps to reproduce (for bugs) or vulnerability details (for security incidents).

  - Streamline incident routing and assignment to the appropriate teams (development or security) based on incident type and severity.

  - Improve communication and collaboration between service desk agents, development/security teams, and other stakeholders.

  - Integrate ServiceNow with JIRA to automatically create and update JIRA issues from ServiceNow incidents, and vice versa.

  - Provide managers with comprehensive reports on incident volume, resolution times, team performance, and trends to identify areas for improvement.

### Requirements

Design a ServiceNow solution that addresses the desired improvements to the incident management process. Your solution should include the following:

1.  **Automated Incident Creation:**

    - Describe the ServiceNow application(s) and feature(s) you would use to automate incident creation from:
      - Service portal
      - Web form
      - Automated monitoring systems
      - Email
    - Justify your choice for each source.
    - Explain how you would ensure that the following incident fields are automatically populated:
      - `Affected System`
      - `Incident Type` (e.g., Bug, Security Incident)
      - `Severity`
      - `Description` (including error messages, steps to reproduce, or vulnerability details)
      - `Reported By` (Internal Employee, Customer)

2.  **Incident Routing and Management:**

    - Describe the ServiceNow application(s) and feature(s) you would use to automate incident routing and assignment to the appropriate teams (development or security).
    - Explain how you would determine the appropriate team based on the `Incident Type` and `Affected System`.
    - Describe how you would automate notifications to the assigned team and other stakeholders.
    - Explain how you would use ServiceNow functionality to:
      - Track incident status (e.g., New, Assigned, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).
      - Enforce the completion of the following fields before an incident can be closed:
        - `Resolution Details`
        - `Close Date`

3.  **Integration with JIRA:**

    - Describe how you would integrate ServiceNow with JIRA to:
      - Automatically create a JIRA issue from a ServiceNow incident.
      - Keep the ServiceNow incident and JIRA issue synchronized with relevant updates (e.g., status, comments).
    - What ServiceNow features or applications would you use?

4.  **Reporting:**

    - Describe the type of ServiceNow report(s) you would create to provide managers with insights into incident management performance.
    - Explain how you would configure the report(s) to include the following information:
      - Total number of incidents by source
      - Average incident resolution time by assignment group and priority
      - Number of incidents in each status, broken down by assignment group
      - Top 10 most frequent incident types
      - Trends in incident volume over time

### Deliverables

- A detailed description of your proposed ServiceNow solution, including:
  - An explanation of the ServiceNow applications, features, and configurations you would use.
  - A justification for your design choices, focusing on how they address the requirements and improve the incident management process.
  - Considerations for data quality, user experience, performance, scalability, and integration with JIRA and other systems.
- Diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the automated processes (optional but recommended).
