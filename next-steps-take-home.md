# Next Steps

## Take Home Assignment

You will work on the solution prior to the interview. During our call together, we will ask you to demo the project with a walkthrough. We'll then step through the various aspects of your solution to discuss your implementation details, find out what hiccups you ran into, what you might do if you had more time, and other nerdy details!

Please do not to spend more than a few hours in completing this project. We are not necessarily looking for a production ready application, and it's okay if you don't finish all of the requirements. The goal is to get a feel for how you think and set up a great conversation.

Please submit the project at least 4 hours before your scheduled interview. This will allow us time to preview it before the interview.

### 1. GitHub Repository

- Create a **public GitHub repository** to submit your solution. The repository should contain the full implementation, including any required files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to build and run the web application.
- The repository must include:
  - A **clear, concise README** with the following:
    - Description of the project.
    - How to build and run it locally.
    - Any other details that would help us understand your implementation (e.g., architectural decisions, libraries used, etc.).
  - **Code Comments**: Ensure your code is well-commented to explain key sections of your logic, especially any complex or non-obvious parts.

### 2. Deployment (optional)

This may not be relevant to all types of challenges. So disregard if not applicable or if you run out of time.

- Host your project on a service like Netlify, Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, or similar hosting options.
- Provide a link to the live project in your README file.
