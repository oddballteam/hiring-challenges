## Beneficiary Support System

### Description

A federal government agency uses Salesforce to manage beneficiary support interactions. They want to automate and streamline several steps to improve efficiency, accuracy, and the overall beneficiary experience. The following outlines the current support process and the desired improvements:

- **Current Process:**

  - Beneficiaries contact the agency through various channels: phone, email, webchat, and mail.
  - Support agents manually create cases in Salesforce to track beneficiary issues and requests. This manual case creation leads to inconsistencies in data entry, delays in response times, and the potential for lost information.
  - Support agents manage cases through various stages (e.g., New, In Progress, Pending Input, Resolved, Closed).
  - Agents manually update case details, including the beneficiary's contact information, inquiry type, and resolution.
  - Supervisors need reports on case status, resolution times, and common inquiry types to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement, but current reporting is time-consuming and lacks the necessary detail.

- **Desired Improvements:**

  - Automate case creation from phone, email, and webchat interactions to ensure data consistency, improve agent efficiency, and reduce data entry errors.
  - Ensure accurate capture of beneficiary contact information, inquiry type, and other relevant case details to improve data quality and enable better analysis of support trends.
  - Streamline the case management process to reflect different stages and dependencies, such as when beneficiary input is needed.
  - Provide supervisors with comprehensive reports on case volume, resolution times, and common inquiry types to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and improve service delivery.

### Requirements

Design a Salesforce solution that addresses the desired improvements to the beneficiary support process. Your solution should include the following:

1.  **Automated Case Creation:**

    - Describe the Salesforce automation tool(s) you would use to automate case creation from phone, email, and webchat interactions. Justify your choice for each channel.
    - Explain how you would ensure that the following case fields are automatically populated:
      - `Contact`: Link to the beneficiary's contact record.
      - `Inquiry Type`: (e.g., Eligibility, Benefits, Claims)
      - `Status`: New
      - `Origin`: (e.g., Phone, Email, Webchat)
    - Describe how you would handle cases originating from mail.

2.  **Case Management Automation:**

    - Describe the Salesforce automation tool(s) you would use to automate case status updates. Consider scenarios such as:
      - When a case is assigned to an agent, the status changes to "In Progress."
      - When a case is waiting for information from the beneficiary, the status changes to "Pending Input."
      - When a case is resolved, the status changes to "Resolved."
    - Explain how you would use Salesforce validation rules to enforce the completion of the following fields before a case can be closed:
      - `Resolution Details`
      - `Close Date`

3.  **Reporting:**

    - Describe the type of Salesforce report(s) you would create to provide supervisors with insights into case volume, resolution times, and common inquiry types.
    - Explain how you would configure the report(s) to include the following information:
      - Total number of cases by origin (Phone, Email, Webchat, Mail)
      - Average case resolution time by inquiry type
      - Number of cases in each status, broken down by assigned agent
      - Top 10 most frequent inquiry types

### Deliverables

- A detailed description of your proposed Salesforce solution, including:
  - An explanation of the Salesforce automation tools, validation rules, and report types you would use.
  - A justification for your design choices, focusing on how they address the requirements and improve the beneficiary support process.
  - Considerations for data quality, user experience, and potential issues (e.g., governor limits, scalability, integration with other systems).
- Diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the automated processes (optional but recommended).
