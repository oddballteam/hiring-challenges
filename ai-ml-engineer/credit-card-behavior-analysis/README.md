# Credit Card Customer Behavior Analysis

### Background
We have provided a dataset on Kaggle that contains data about credit card transactions and customer behavior. The dataset can be found at the following link:
[Credit Card Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata?resource=download)

This dataset includes various features about customers' credit card usage patterns, such as balance, purchase behavior, cash advances, credit limits, and payment history. Your task is to analyze the customer behavior using **unsupervised learning techniques** to uncover distinct customer segments.

### Objective
Using **unsupervised learning**, specifically **clustering analysis**, you will identify distinct customer segments and their characteristic behaviors based on their credit card usage patterns. Your analysis should help inform strategic business decisions, such as targeted marketing or risk management strategies.

### Data Description
The dataset includes the following features for each customer:
- **Balance**: The customer's current balance on their credit card.
- **Balance Frequency**: How often the customerâ€™s balance is updated.
- **Purchase Types**: Different types of purchases, such as one-off purchases versus installment-based payments.
- **Cash Advances**: Whether the customer uses cash advances, and the frequency of these actions.
- **Credit Limit Utilization**: The percentage of the credit limit being used by the customer.
- **Payment Patterns**: Customer payment history, indicating how consistently and timely they make payments.
- **Tenure**: The length of time the customer has held the credit card.

### Task
1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**:
    - Clean the dataset, handle any missing or anomalous data, and scale the features where necessary.
    - Consider transforming features or creating new ones if it improves the quality of your analysis.
  
2. **Clustering Algorithm Selection**:
    - Choose an appropriate **clustering algorithm(s)** (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering).
    - Justify your choice of algorithm based on the nature of the data and the goal of uncovering meaningful customer segments.
  
3. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**:
    - Use techniques such as the **Elbow Method**, **Silhouette Score**, or other methods to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  
4. **Customer Segment Analysis**:
    - Analyze and describe the segments you identified. What are the key characteristics of each cluster? For example, do certain clusters exhibit high credit utilization, or are there distinct payment behavior patterns?
    - Provide a **business interpretation** of each segment. For instance, how might a marketing department target different segments? How can risk management use this information to tailor their strategies?
  
### Deliverables
- **Pre-Interview Submission**: Please submit a **Jupyter notebook** (or any similar document) containing:
  - The code you used for preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering.
  - Visualizations of the clusters and key insights drawn from the analysis.
  - A brief explanation of your thought process, decisions, and findings.
  
- **During the Interview**: Be prepared to discuss:
  - **Methodology**: Describe the steps you took in your analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and why you chose the particular clustering algorithm(s).
  - **Key Findings**: Share insights about the customer segments you identified and how those segments could impact business decisions (marketing, risk, etc.).
  - **Business Implications**: Provide business recommendations based on the clusters, such as targeted actions for specific customer groups.
  - **Limitations and Assumptions**: Discuss any challenges you encountered with the dataset (e.g., missing data, scaling issues) and any assumptions made during the analysis.
  - **Further Exploration**: Identify any additional data that could enhance the analysis, such as new features or external data sources.

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- **Technical Implementation**: How well you implement the clustering analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the selection of algorithms.
- **Depth of Analysis**: The thoroughness of your analysis, including how well you describe the clusters and their business relevance.
- **Business Relevance**: How well your findings can be translated into actionable business strategies or insights.
- **Clarity of Communication**: How clearly and effectively you explain your methodology, findings, and business recommendations.
- **Creativity**: How creatively you approach feature engineering, pattern discovery, and cluster analysis.

### Time Expectation
We expect this assignment to take **no more than 4 hours** to complete. We value **the quality of your analysis** over the quantity of work. Focus on providing actionable insights and a thorough understanding of the customer segments you identify.

### Tips for Success:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Be mindful of any missing data, outliers, or skewed distributions. Address these issues effectively to ensure the clustering algorithm works well.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Remember that different algorithms work better for different data types. Make sure your choice of algorithm aligns with the nature of the features in the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Use visualizations like scatter plots, cluster heatmaps, or pairwise plots to convey the results of your clustering in a clear and compelling way.
- **Interpretation**: Take time to understand the characteristics of each cluster. A good clustering analysis provides not just clusters, but actionable insights based on the features that differentiate each segment.
