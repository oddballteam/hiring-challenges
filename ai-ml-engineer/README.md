## Credit Card Customer Behavior Analysis - Take-Home Assignment

### Background
Below is a link to a Kaggle dataset on credit card purchases:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata?resource=download 
The dataset includes various features such as balance, purchase patterns, cash advances, credit limits, and payment history.

### Task
Using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering analysis, identify distinct customer segments and their characteristic behaviors from the provided credit card transaction data. Your analysis should help inform strategic business decisions.

### Data Description
The dataset contains the following features for each customer:
- Balance and balance frequency
- Different types of purchases (one-off vs. installments)
- Cash advance behavior
- Credit limit utilization
- Payment patterns
- Tenure information

### Requirements
1. Perform necessary data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Implement and justify your choice of clustering algorithm(s)
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters using appropriate methods
4. Provide a detailed analysis of the identified customer segments

### Deliverables
- Prior to the interview, please submit a Jupyter notebook or similar document containing your code and analysis.
- During the interview, please be prepared to discuss:
  - Description of your methodology
  - Key findings about customer segments
  - Business recommendations based on your analysis
  - Discussion of potential limitations such as issues with the data
  - Areas for further investigation such as what additional columns would be helpful for augmenting the analysis (even through non-clustering solutions)

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Technical implementation and code quality
- Depth of analysis and insights
- Business relevance of findings
- Clarity of communication
- Creative approach to feature engineering and pattern discovery

### Time Expectation
Please spend no more than 4 hours on this assignment. We value quality of analysis over quantity.
