# Oddball Hiring Challenges

Congratulations on progressing to the tech challenge stage! We are excited to get to know you better and potentially welcome you to our team at Oddball.

In this phase, we want to evaluate both your technical skillset and your aptitude to communicate your decisions. We will share with you the details of which challenge you have been assigned and any necessary details to be ready for the interview. The desired outcome is not a single prescribed solution or perfection. Instead, we hope this process will allow us to see your creativity, ingenuity, and (most importantly) prompt a great conversation.

## Types of Challenges

We'll communicate with you ahead of the technical interview, which one applies.

### Coding Challenge

For any coding excercise, unless otherwise noted, you will be expected to configure your own local development enviroment. We will likely suggest the tech stack or framework, based on the needs of the position you are applying for.

We have two flavors of coding challenge.

#### Live

If your interview is a live coding challenge, please have the bootstrapped local environment ready to go before the meeting. You should start only with the base starter application and not begin the actual implementation of the challenge.

We will screen share during the interview, so that we can see your realtime progress in completing the excercise. We will expect you to talk through what your decision making and ask questions, much like you might do when pair programming.

#### Take Home

We encourage you to spend no more than four hours in the completion of this assignment. The goal is to have a functioning application, as close to meeting the stated goals as possible in that time. Given the constraints, perfection is not expected.

Your project should be published on a public GitHub repository. Please provide the link to us at least 12 hours before the interview, so that we have time to review it. Optionally (and if applicable), you may publish the project to a public website so that we can interact with it and test the functionality.
