# Hiring Challenges

Congratulations on progressing to the skill assessment stage of our hiring process! We are excited to get to know you better and potentially welcome you to our team at Oddball.

In this phase, we want to evaluate both your skillset and your aptitude to communicate your decisions. We will share with you the details of which challenge you have been assigned and any necessary details to be ready for the interview. The desired outcome is not a single prescribed solution or perfection. Instead, we hope this process will allow us to see your creativity, ingenuity, and (most importantly) prompt a great conversation.

## Types of Challenges

We'll communicate with you ahead of the interview, which one of the following applies.

### Live Coding Challenge

We will likely suggest the tech stack or framework, based on the needs of the position you are applying for. Please have the bootstrapped local environment ready to go before the meeting. You should start only with the base starter application and not begin the actual implementation of the challenge.

We will screen share during the interview, so that we can see your realtime progress in completing the excercise. We will expect you to talk through what your decision making and ask questions, much like you might do when pair programming.

### Take Home Coding Challenge

We will likely suggest the tech stack or framework, based on the needs of the position you are applying for. You will create a working application, from scratch, according to the specifications.

We encourage you to spend no more than four hours in the completion of this assignment. The goal is to have a functioning application, as close to meeting the stated goals as possible in that time. Given the constraints, perfection is not expected.

Your project should be published on a public GitHub repository. Please provide the link to us at least 12 hours before the interview, so that we have time to review it. Optionally (and if applicable), you may publish the project to a public website so that we can interact with it and test the functionality.

### Architecture Design Challenge

We will provide you with a product description and general guidance of the hypothetical system we need to create. Your job will be to flesh out the details and put together a plan. This may include whiteboard diagrams, product roadmaps, a presentation, or other documentation. We will give you specific guidance based on the role.

### Architecture Review Challenge

We will provide you documentation about a hypothetical existing system. This will include diagrams and descriptions of the product, team, and tech stack. Additionally, we'll share some of the challenges we are facing or improvements we desire to make.

You'll be given time to read through it before the interview, so that you can come in with good perspective. We'll allow you to ask questions to answer specifics about it, which will inform your suggestions of what improvements we can make. You will take on a consultant persona in this challenge.
